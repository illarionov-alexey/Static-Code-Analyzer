<h2>The imports</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p><p>There is a predefined variable <code class="java">code</code> that contains the source code. Write a program that will traverse the tree and print the name of each <code class="java">Import</code>. Each name should be on a new line.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can solve the problem however it is most convenient to you but, in case you're going to use <code class="java">ast.NodeVisitor</code> class, keep in mind that <code class="java">Import</code> node class has <code class="java">names</code> attribute which is a list of <code class="java">alias</code> nodes. To access their actual names, just refer to their <code class="java">name</code> attribute.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
